                    A blog, short for weblog, is an online journal or informational website that presents information in reverse chronological order, with the latest posts appearing first.14 It is a platform where a writer or a group of writers share their views on an individual subject.

                        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that combines computer science and robust datasets to enable problem-solving. It encompasses sub-fields of machine learning and deep learning.0 AI is concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.2 While there are no AIs that can perform the wide variety of tasks an ordinary human can do, some AIs can match humans in specific tasks.1 Advancements in machine learning and deep learning are creating a paradigm shift in virtually every sector of the tech industry.2

                        OpenAI is an American artificial intelligence (AI) research laboratory consisting of the non-profit OpenAI and its for-profit subsidiary corporation OpenAI Limited Partnership. OpenAI conducts AI research with the declared intention of developing "safe and beneficial" artificial general intelligence, which it defines as "highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work".[4]

OpenAI was founded in 2015 by Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman, Trevor Blackwell, Vicki Cheung, Andrej Karpathy, Durk Kingma, Jessica Livingston, John Schulman, Pamela Vagata, and Wojciech Zaremba, with Sam Altman and Elon Musk serving as the initial board members.[5][6][7] Microsoft provided OpenAI LP with a $1 billion investment in 2019 and a $10 billion investment in 2023.

                        Chandrayaan-3 is third and most recent lunar Indian Space Research exploration mission under Chandrayaan programme. It consists of a lander named Vikram and a rover named Pragyan similar to Chandrayaan-2, but does not have an orbiter. Its propulsion module behaves like a communication relay satellite. The propulsion module carries the lander and rover configuration until the spacecraft is in a 100 km lunar orbit.Chandrayaan-3 is third and most recent lunar Indian Space Research exploration mission under Chandrayaan programme.
